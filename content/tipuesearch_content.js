The pages you see here are all\xa0 wiki \xa0or\xa0 embedded documentation \xa0or (in the case of the\xa0 download \xa0page)\xa0 unversioned files . When you clone Fossil from one of its\xa0 self-hosting repositories , you get more than just source code - you get this entire website. \n \n \n All-in-one \xa0- Fossil is a single self-contained, stand-alone executable. To install, simply download a\xa0 precompiled binary \xa0for Linux, Mac, or Windows and put it on your $PATH.\xa0 Easy-to-compile source code \xa0is also available. \n \n \n Self-host Friendly \xa0- Stand up a project website in minutes using\xa0 a variety of techniques . Fossil is CPU and memory efficient. Most projects can be hosted comfortably on a $5/month VPS or a Raspberry Pi. You can also set up an automatic\xa0 GitHub mirror . \n \n \n Simple Networking \xa0- Fossil uses ordinary HTTPS (or SSH if you prefer) for network communications, so it works fine from behind firewalls and\xa0 proxies . The protocol is\xa0 bandwidth efficient \xa0to the point that Fossil can be used comfortably over dial-up, weak 3G, or airliner Wifi. \n \n \n Autosync \xa0- Fossil supports\xa0 "autosync" mode \xa0which helps to keep projects moving forward by reducing the amount of needless\xa0 forking and merging \xa0often associated with distributed projects. \n \n \n Robust & Reliable \xa0- Fossil stores content using an\xa0 enduring file format \xa0in an SQLite database so that transactions are atomic even if interrupted by a power loss or system crash. Automatic\xa0 self-checks \xa0verify that all aspects of the repository are consistent prior to each commit. \n \n \n Free and Open-Source \xa0-\xa0 2-clause BSD license . \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Fossil SCM.html'}, {'title': 'NSSM', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'NSSM.html'}, {'title': 'Stunnel', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Stunnel.html'}, {'title': 'Nginx', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Nginx.html'}, {'title': 'SSL 憑證', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'SSL 憑證.html'}, {'title': 'fossiloauth', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'fossiloauth.html'}, {'title': 'fossilapp', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'fossilapp.html'}, {'title': 'Source', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Source.html'}]};
